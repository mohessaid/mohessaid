### Hi there 👋

Mohessaid stands for Mohammed Essaid, nothing fancy, just an abbreviation people used to call me. He’s a software engineer wielding a gleaming PHP shield and sturdy armor forged in the C family. With a JavaScript katana in hand, he rides an eager young Gopher, fearlessly traversing the tech war zone. Recently, he’s begun wielding the enchanted Ruby crystal and experimenting with Elixir potions to unlock new powers. Oh, and like a true Parselmouth, he speaks the language of the snake.
