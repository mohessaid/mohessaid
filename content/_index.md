Mohessaid stands for Mohammed Essaid, nothing fancy, just an abbreviation people used to call me. Heâ€™s a software engineer wielding a gleaming PHP shield and sturdy armor forged in the C family. With a JavaScript katana in hand, he rides an eager young Gopher, fearlessly traversing the tech war zone. Recently, heâ€™s begun wielding the enchanted Ruby crystal and experimenting with Elixir potions to unlock new powers. Oh, and like a true Parselmouth, he speaks the language of the snake.
