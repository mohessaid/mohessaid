I decided to run a little expirement on writing platforms. I didn't have the right article until I faced an issue building this website on Vercel.

I published a post on how I fixed the issue on different platforms online. This idea came to mind after seeing some posts doing well on [Medium](https://mohessaid.medium.com). So I wanted to try other paltforms as well.

I will update this post every other day to see how the stats are doing. Also, how the race for the first spot in search results is going.

The metrics in above are based on Medium. They can differ from paltform to another. I will try to update them accordinally after I see some results.
