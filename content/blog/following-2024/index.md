Around 7:00 a.m today. I checked on LinkedIn out of curiousity to see what's going on.
I stumbled on this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bassemdghaidy_programming-coding-softwareengineering-ugcPost-7258865232326934528-jiZS) where Bassem Dghaidi shared his list of recommended books and channels on YouTube.
I know some of what he shared in his list. However, I wanted to share what I find 
worthy of following. I started writing a comment on  his post. However, the list 
kept growing. Since I live by the rule Scott Henslman once mentioned in his blog.
When you write an email, comment to somebody and it becomes longer than it should. 
Post it as a blog post and share it with him and whoever want that information.

Here is my full list of:

# YouTube Channels

I love YouTube. I love visual content. I think, I'm good on holding back on consuming everything though.
For YouTube, I only subscribe to channels that meet these criteria:

1. Their content interest me obviously.
2. Don't over post.
3. Unique style (compared to their category).

With that in mind, I have been following the following channels:

## [Fireship](https://youtube.com/fireship)

You know it. You should follow it.

## [Isaac Harris-Holt](https://www.youtube.com/@IsaacHarrisHolt)

I have been searching for one of his videos for days. He has a list title "X Language for Impatient Devs." 
Great videos about different programming languages.

Recently, he is talking about Gleam the new Functional Programming Language.

## [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate)

I subscribed to him for his Rust videos. He has one named "[Rust for the Impatient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br3GIIQeefY)" 
Yes, like Isaac. Seems like somone wrote a post about it and he used it as a reference.
He talks about other things as well.
