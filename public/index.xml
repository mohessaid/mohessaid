      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around 7:00 a.m today. I checked on LinkedIn out of curiousity to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&#xA;I stumbled on this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bassemdghaidy_programming-coding-softwareengineering-ugcPost-7258865232326934528-jiZS&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; where Bassem Dghaidi shared his list of recommended books and channels on YouTube.&#xA;I know some of what he shared in his list. However, I wanted to share what I find&#xA;worthy of following. I started writing a comment on  his post. However, the list&#xA;kept growing. Since I live by the rule Scott Henslman once mentioned in his blog.&#xA;When you write an email, comment to somebody and it becomes longer than it should.&#xA;Post it as a blog post and share it with him and whoever want that information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to add my SVG logo to the header of this website. I found some solutions, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
